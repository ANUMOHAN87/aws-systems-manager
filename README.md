# AWS Systems Manager
Welcome to the Systems Manager community! Systems Manager allows you to automate common administrative tasks across resources on AWS and on-premises. Using Systems Manager you can group resources by applications, and automate operational tasks on those resources such as remote management, collecting inventory, patching and configuration management.
